# Final-Project
Full stack website designed for reporting local incidents, offering local resources, and giving professional help.

# Contribution:

I helped put togther the information flow diagram and the enhanced entity-relationship diagram found in Phase 1.
In Phase 3, I worked largely on the frontend of the website inside React and on the Resource Results, Resource Report and New Incident pages.
